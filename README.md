# üìä Data Analytics Using Python Projects

**About This Repository**
This repository contains end-to-end data analytics projects leveraging Python to conduct exploratory data analysis, basic machine learning and data visualisaton projects from raw data. Each project demonstrates real-world problem-solving through data exploration, cleaning, and analysis showcasing proficiency in data analysis and Python.

**üîç Projects Overview**

## Project 1 - üå± Soil Composition Analysis
This project explores a soil composition dataset containing macro and micronutrient levels (like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, EC, etc.) along with labeled crop types.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand nutrient distribution across different fruits/crops
- Visualize nutrient patterns using barplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps

## Project 2 - üå≥ Decision Tree Hyperparameter Tuning: A Comparative Tutorial
This project is a practical tutorial that explores how hyperparameter tuning affects the accuracy and behavior of Decision Tree models using a sample dataset in Python.
üîç What‚Äôs Covered:
- Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier on a random dataset
- Application of three hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Grid Search, Randomized Search and Bayesian Optimization 
- Visualization of accuracy changes and model performance as parameters are tuned
- Final comparison of all three tuning strategies, highlighting their efficiency, performance, and optimal parameter choices
