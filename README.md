# üìä Data Analytics Using Python Projects

**About This Repository**
This repository contains end-to-end data analytics projects leveraging Python to conduct exploratory data analysis, basic machine learning and data visualisaton projects from raw data. Each project demonstrates real-world problem-solving through data exploration, cleaning, and analysis showcasing proficiency in data analysis and Python.

**üîç Projects Overview**

## Project 1 - üå± Soil Composition Analysis
This project explores a soil composition dataset containing macro and micronutrient levels (like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, EC, etc.) along with labeled crop types.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand nutrient distribution across different fruits/crops
- Visualize nutrient patterns using barplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps

## Project 2 - üå≥ Decision Tree Hyperparameter Tuning: A Comparative Tutorial
This project is a practical tutorial that explores how hyperparameter tuning affects the accuracy and behavior of Decision Tree models using a sample dataset in Python.
üîç What‚Äôs Covered:
- Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier on a random dataset
- Application of three hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Grid Search, Randomized Search and Bayesian Optimization 
- Visualization of accuracy changes and model performance as parameters are tuned
- Final comparison of all three tuning strategies, highlighting their efficiency, performance, and optimal parameter choices

## Project 3 - üèôÔ∏è NYC SAT Scores Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing SAT performance data from New York City public high schools to identify academic trends and top-performing institutions. Using Python and Pandas, I explored patterns in SAT scores across boroughs, evaluated summary statistics, and identified:

-Top 10 Best Performing Schools based on average SAT scores
-Best Math Schools based on math-specific performance
-Borough-wise Performance Visualizations to compare regional trends
The project applies core data analysis techniques including data cleaning, aggregation, grouping, and visualization using libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.
