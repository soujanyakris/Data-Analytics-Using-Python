# üìä Data Analytics Using Python Projects

**About This Repository**
This repository contains end-to-end data analytics projects leveraging Python to conduct exploratory data analysis, basic machine learning and data visualisaton projects from raw data. Each project demonstrates real-world problem-solving through data exploration, cleaning, and analysis showcasing proficiency in data analysis and Python.

**üîç Projects Overview**

## Project 1 - üå± Soil Composition Analysis
This project explores a soil composition dataset containing macro and micronutrient levels (like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, EC, etc.) along with labeled crop types.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand nutrient distribution across different fruits/crops
- Visualize nutrient patterns using barplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps

## Project 2 - üå≥ Decision Tree Hyperparameter Tuning: A Comparative Tutorial
This project is a practical tutorial that explores how hyperparameter tuning affects the accuracy and behavior of Decision Tree models using a sample dataset in Python.
üîç What‚Äôs Covered:
- Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier on a random dataset
- Application of three hyperparameter optimization techniques such as Grid Search, Randomized Search and Bayesian Optimization 
- Visualization of accuracy changes and model performance as parameters are tuned
- Final comparison of all three tuning strategies, highlighting their efficiency, performance, and optimal parameter choices

## Project 3 - üèôÔ∏è NYC SAT Scores Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing SAT performance data from New York City public high schools to identify academic trends and top-performing institutions. Using Python and Pandas, I explored patterns in SAT scores across boroughs, evaluated summary statistics, and identified:

- Top 10 Best Performing Schools based on average SAT scores
- Best Math Schools based on math-specific performance
- Borough-wise Performance Visualizations to compare regional trends
The project applies core data analysis techniques including data cleaning, aggregation, grouping, and visualization using libraries like Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib.

## Project 4 - üéì Nobel Prize Winners Analysis
This project explores historical Nobel Prize winner data to uncover trends, answer insightful questions, and practice key data analysis skills using Python and pandas. In this analysis, I explored the Nobel Prize dataset to investigate a variety of questions, such as:

- Which categories have had the most winners?
- What is the gender distribution over the years?
- Which decades had the highest proportions of U.S.-born winners?
- Who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize?

### Skills Practiced
This project helped strengthen my skills in: Data aggregation with groupby(), Summary statistics with Min(),Max(),Mean(), Subsetting and filtering DataFrames and Creating visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn

## Project 5 - üìä Crime Analysis in Los Angeles
This project involves analyzing crime data from Los Angeles to assist the LAPD in identifying patterns in criminal activity. The goal is to support strategic decision-making around resource allocation and crime prevention. Key objectives include:

- Understand the frequency and distribution of crimes across LA.
- Analyze temporal trends to determine when crimes are most likely to occur.
- Identify which communities are most affected by specific crime types.

### Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and manipulation using pandas
- Aggregation and grouping to analyze trends and hotspots
- Visualization with seaborn and matplotlib (e.g., countplots) to explore patterns in time, type, and location of crimes
